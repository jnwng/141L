# program 3

# NOTES
# Given array memory locations: 128 - 64
# Hash table memory locations: 0 - 64
# Hash table: 0 offset = key, 1 offset = value
# Global (before end label):
# $s0 = current place in hash table (the end of it)
# $s1 = current index (address) in the array
# Loop_hash:
# $t1 = current loop index
# $c1 = current hash table index
# $c2 = end of hash table (address)
# end:
# $t3 = greatest so far
# $t1 = current index in hash table (address)
# $c2 = end of the hash table
# Global (after end label):
# $s0 = current place in hash table (the end of it)
# $s1 = the number occuring the most


# The Setup
res 0           # initialize s0
cpout $s0       #   by setting it to 0
res 128         # initialize s1
cpout $s1       #   by setting it to 128 (starting position of array)

# here we loop through the array, or every element of the given array (32)
# for each value in the array we search through the hash table to see if it 
# already exists, and we increment the number's value (the number is the key 
# in the hash table) by 1. Otherwise a new entry is made for the number.
# We do a check at the beginning to make sure the address of the array (IE 
# its recorded index) is not 64, if it is, the array is finished, and we 
# begin processing the hash table.

# here we check if the current array index (in $s1) is 64, if so we end the loop
